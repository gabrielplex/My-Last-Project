                The first website I created this year was a mock tourist website, called “Chronoshift.” This website was
                made
                mainly with HTML and CSS. We used the Figma program to design the wireframe of the website, and then
                made
                the
                website itself. The pages included information about the false website, the workers, goals, and contact
                information.

                The instructions said we needed a Home Page, an About Us page, an Expeditions page, a Rules page, and a
                Book
                Now
                page. The page needed some images, and colors for the website.

                I liked the look of my website at first, as the colors and the style really fit the story of the mock
                website, though I think the website was too messed up than what I wanted from the website, and I really
                wished I did better with the CSS. I also hate how I constantly didn’t know what to do or how to do HTML.

                I constantly used Collaboration and Communication, as Veer did a good job to figure out how to do
                coding. It
                sucks that the coding is a lot more time consuming to understand than just doing the darn thing, though
                my
                persistence as to not give up and learn how to do it is what kept me going though the project.

                The second website I created this year was a collaborative website with some of my fellow students. We
                used
                the Figma program to design the website’s wireframe, then worked on the website itself. The pages
                included a
                Home Page, an information page with sites that can be traveled to, an about page, a discover page, and a
                visit page.

                I really got better at coding with HTML, and got a better understanding with CSS. I mainly worked with
                my page only, as requested by my coworkers, then copy-pasted the page's code to the other pages. My
                coworkers then edited the pages so that they could make it similar to their countries.

                I liked the website in the end. While It wasn’t what I had intended to be in the end, I still liked how
                it turned out. I still think that I should have taken some time to figure some stuff out, so I should
                have worked on it at home. I’m glad that I worked with the coworkers I got in with, as it was easy to
                work with them.

                I pushed hard for Persistence, and really pushed myself hard because of how easy it was to understand
                the
                code. I’m glad that I could understand the code and that I could understand how to work with teammates.
                I
                think I need to work with timing and asking other teams how they got around similar problems.

                The third website I created this year is an Interactive Storyline, a project that I worked with another
                student, Brock Dunning. We used the Lucidchart program to design the paths you could take with the
                website-game. Each choice could bring you to a different path, and you won't be guaranteed to get the
                same
                ending that a different path could take you to.

                I learned a lot of how to do the coding of the code with the teachings of Mr. Fast, but also from how
                others
                took on similar problems in the code. I was able to get lots of the work done, and could finish it
                quickly
                and efficiently. I also learned how to quickly make code that could change text immediately.

                I was successful in understanding how others addressed similar problems I faced, and I’m most proud of
                figuring out how to address the problem with my own solution (inspired by other code). One of the
                challenges
                I faced was getting it to work sometimes, as the process of just understanding the right piece of code
                to
                use in a situation that was appropriate and what was an inappropriate time was difficult to figure out.

                The CART Habits of mind I exercised a lot in was Persistence, as well as Creativity in dealing with the
                problems of the code. I feel like I should have focused on Collaboration, as Brock and I agreed that I
                could
                work on the code early while he took care of other issues, like sending our still-working example code
                to
                Mr. Fast.
